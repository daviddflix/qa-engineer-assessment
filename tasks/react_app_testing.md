   - End-to-end testing of user workflows

2. Specify which testing libraries and tools you would use for React app testing and explain your choices.

3. Describe your approach to:
   - Testing form validation and submission
   - Mocking API calls and testing data fetching
   - Testing state management (e.g., Redux or Context API)
   - Testing filtering and sorting functionality

4. Outline a plan for visual regression testing and cross-browser compatibility testing.

5. Explain how you would implement performance testing, focusing on data loading and rendering large datasets.

6. Describe your strategy for testing real-time data updates and handling of concurrent users.
