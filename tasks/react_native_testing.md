3. Data submission to backend API
4. Data retrieval and display in mobile-friendly formats
5. Filtering and sorting capabilities
6. Offline mode and data synchronization

## Requirements

1. Create a comprehensive test plan covering:
   - Functional testing of all app features
   - UI/UX testing for mobile interfaces
   - Performance testing on different devices and network conditions

2. Specify which testing frameworks and tools you would use for React Native app testing and justify your choices.

3. Describe your approach to:
   - Testing responsive design and layout across different screen sizes
   - Validating touch interactions and gestures
   - Testing offline functionality and data synchronization
   - Cross-platform compatibility testing (iOS and Android)

4. Outline a strategy for automated UI testing and continuous integration for the React Native app.

5. Explain how you would test the app's performance, focusing on data loading, rendering, and battery consumption.
